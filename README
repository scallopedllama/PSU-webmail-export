 This is a somewhate simple script useful to former students of PSU
 who foolishly used its crappy webmail client without having the 
 "Leave messages on POP server" option ticked. It will parse a folder
 full of html files that are saved emails from the webmail client,
 parse out all useful information and create a proper mdir folder that
 can be easily imported into a mail client like kmail.
 
 The quick and simple way to export all your mail to gmail:
 1. Gather requirements:
	Only ever tested on linux with bash 4.1.7.
	You need to have awk, sed, kmail, and uuencode installed (search your distro's repositories)
 2. Use a mass download extension of your choice in the browser of your choice.
	I used DownThemALL! on Firefox.
	a. Open your webmail to your inbox and highlight all of the subject line hyperlinks.
	b. Go to Tools > DownThemALL! Tools > DownThemALL!
	c. Save all the files some place relevant and don't let it overwrite the files
	   (They'll all be retrieve.cgi.html)
	   I recommend giving each webmail folder its own folder full of these html files.
	d. Repeat for all your mail folders and do the same to get all your attachments, save
	   those in a folder called Attachments. Don't forget your sent emails.
 3. Now you should have a directory structure like the following:
	root
	  |- Inbox
	  |- Sent
	  |- OneFolder (Don't have spaces in these folder names)
	  |- SecondFolder
	  |- Attachments
	  psuConvert.sh
     Make sure that the psuConvert.sh file is in the folder above your mail and attachments folders
     and make sure it is executable
      $ chmod +x psuConvert.sh
 4. Start converting the folders with the tool. The syntax is as follows:
      $ ./psuConvert.sh [Foldername]
    Where [Foldername] is the name of the folder to process. For the above example you would have to run
    the script 4 times:
      $ ./psuConvert.sh Inbox
        # snip
      $ ./psuConvert.sh Sent
        # snip
      $ ./psuConvert.sh OneFolderystem
        # snip
      $ ./psuConvert.sh SecondFolder
        # snip
    The scripts' progress through the folder will be detailed, all the messages will be saved in a new folder
    with the same name as the input one with "convd_" prepended to it, so convd_Inbox for the above.
 5. This will leave you with a folder full of files that are properly formatted to be dropped DIRECTLY into kmail's
    mail folders which are located in ~/.kde4/share/apps/kmail/mail
    In there, you will want to make a folder to represent each group of mail (Like Import-Imbox) and in each of those
    make the following three folders: cur, new, and tmp.
 6. Move each folder's convd_ files into the cur folder of its representive group in kmail's folders.
 7. Start kmail, you should see all of your emails in there with all their attachments properly added (unless the file
    wasn't found).
 8. Add your Gmail account to kmail using IMAP. Add labels to differentiate between the folders, then simply highlight
    all the messages in your converted folders and drag them into the corresponding folder under your gmail account.
    I'd recommend copying when it asks.
 9. Sit back and relax while it all uploads. When it's done, it'll be in your Gmail account properly threaded and everything.
 10. Tell me if the script worked for you, was helpful, etc.
